# 1.  Load a file containing the text or document you want to analyze.
# 2.  As you load the file line by line, keep a count of how many lines there were (one of your statistics taken care of).
# 3.  Put the text into a string and measure its length to get your character count.
# 4.  Temporarily remove all whitespace and measure the length of the resulting string to get the character count excluding spaces.
# 5.  Split out all the whitespace to find out how many words there are.
# 6.  Split on full stops to find out how many sentences there are.
# 7.  Split on double newlines to find out how many paragraphs there are.
# 8.  Perform calculations to work out the averages.
